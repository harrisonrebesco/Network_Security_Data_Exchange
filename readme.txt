This folder contains the written report 	
and all .java files required to compile and 	
run assignment. 

I have only used 3 java files, so you can just 
compile with 'javac *.java' 

To run, open two terminals pathing to the root 
folder. 
 
In the first terminal type: 'java Server'
In the second, type: 'java Client'

This is all you need to run the simulation.
Enjoy!
